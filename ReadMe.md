# PinFinance

A protocol for short-term lending and borrowing services through a peer-funding structure. At Pinfinance, we provide a groundbreaking approach to peer-to-peer group lending and borrowing that combines inclusivity, transparency, and control. While other lending platforms rely on centralized liquidity pools with predetermined and algorithm-driven interest rates, Simplifi flips the script.
